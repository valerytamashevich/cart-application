# kotlin-mvvm-coroutine-room-test-application

A simple Android application that displays a list of products.
Application has MVVM architecture with ViewModel, uses Navigation Component, Koin, Coroutines, Room, Glide 4.+,
handles rotations and offline mode.

Application uses Glide for downloading and caching. The default caching strategy, AUTOMATIC,
tries to use the optimal strategy for local and remote images. AUTOMATIC will store
only the unmodified data backing your load when youâ€™re loading remote data (like from URLs)
because downloading remote data is expensive compared to resizing data already on disk.
